    "stem": "During a community festival, a local bakery set up a booth to sell its pastries. To attract customers, the bakery displayed a large sign that read, 'The Best Pastries in Town!' and included an enticing photograph of their signature cupcake. Jane, a customer, saw the sign and purchased a cupcake. After taking a bite, she realized the cupcake was stale and had a strange taste. Upset, she dropped it, and when it hit the ground, it shattered, causing a piece of the cupcake to fly and hit Mike, a passerby, in the eye, resulting in a minor injury. Mike later sued the bakery for negligence. Which of the following statements best captures the bakery's potential liability in this scenario?",
    "choices": [
      "Choice A: The bakery is liable for negligence because the sign created a false impression about the quality of the cupcake, leading to a foreseeable injury.",
      "Choice B: The bakery is not liable for negligence because there was no direct action by the bakery that caused Mike’s injury.",
      "Choice C: The bakery is liable for negligence because it failed to warn customers about the potential for stale pastries, which is a direct cause of Mike's injury.",
      "Choice D: The bakery is not liable for negligence because Mike’s injury was not a foreseeable result of the bakery's actions."
    ],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "The bakery is not liable for negligence because the customer’s injury was not a direct result of any negligent behavior by the bakery. The injury to Mike was caused by Jane's action of dropping the cupcake, not by any defect in the product itself or any failure on the bakery's part to ensure the quality of its pastries. Without a direct causal link to the bakery's conduct, liability for the injury does not attach.",

Which of the following is the most likely outcome of the lawsuit?",

In her haste, she trips over a tree root and falls, injuring her ankle. The owner of the loose dog, Bob, was not present at the time of the incident. Alice sues Bob for negligence. Which of the following is MOST likely to be a key issue in Alice's claim against Bob?",
    "choices": [
      "Whether Bob had a duty to control his dog while it was off-leash.",
      "Whether Alice was walking her dog in a public park.",

    "correctIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "In a negligence claim, a plaintiff must establish that the defendant had a duty of care to the plaintiff. Here, the key issue is whether Bob, as the owner of the loose dog, had a duty to control his dog, which was off-leash. If Bob breached that duty by allowing his dog to run freely, he may be liable for Alice's injuries.",

One day, while shooting a group of clients in a public park, a dog runs up to her and accidentally knocks her over, causing her to drop her camera and break it. The dog's owner, John, runs over and apologizes, explaining that his dog is usually well-behaved but got startled by a loud noise. Maria wants to sue John for the cost of her broken camera. What is the most likely outcome of Maria's lawsuit against John?",
    "choices": [
      "A) Maria will win because John is strictly liable for any harm caused by his dog.",

Additionally, Maria was in a public park where encounters with dogs are foreseeable, which makes it difficult to establish liability against John.",

As part of his performance, he used a large canvas that was positioned on the grass near a playground.

The spectator suffered damages and sought compensation from the artist, claiming negligence. Which of the following statements is MOST accurate regarding the artist's potential liability? \n\nA) The artist is liable because he should have anticipated that children would be playing near his setup.\nB) The artist is not liable because the child’s actions were an unforeseeable intervening cause.\nC) The artist is liable because he failed to adequately supervise the area around his booth.\nD) The artist is not liable because he was engaged in an artistic performance and cannot be held responsible for distractions.",

This includes ensuring that the area around his booth was safe and that any potentially hazardous items, like paint, were secured. The foreseeability of children in the vicinity creates a standard of care that the artist failed to meet, making him potentially liable for the damages caused.",
