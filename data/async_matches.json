During the drive, she negligently collided with Bob, causing him serious injuries. Bob, aware that Alice was distracted by her phone, filed a lawsuit against both Alice and Corp X for negligence. Corp X claims that Alice was acting within the scope of her employment at the time of the accident. However, Alice had just taken a detour to grab coffee for herself, which Corp X argues was outside the scope of her employment duties. Bob asserts that Corp X is vicariously liable for Alice's actions because she was driving a company vehicle. The court must determine if Alice’s actions were within the scope of employment and whether Corp X can be held liable under the doctrine of vicarious liability.",

        "explanation": "The key issue here is whether Corp X is vicariously liable for Alice's negligence under the doctrine of respondeat superior. Under common law, an employer may be held vicariously liable for the negligent acts of an employee if such acts occur within the scope of employment. The Restatement (Second) of Agency provides that an employee's conduct is within the scope of employment when it is of the kind the employee is employed to perform and occurs substantially within the authorized time and space limits. In this case, Alice was performing a task that was part of her job—delivering products—despite the detour. This slight deviation does not necessarily remove her actions from the scope of employment. The courts often consider whether the deviation is substantial or merely a minor detour. Therefore, Corp X is likely vicariously liable for Alice's negligence. \n\nOption B is incorrect because while the detour could suggest a deviation, it does not automatically exclude vicarious liability if the act was still related to her employment. Option C is incorrect because Alice's distraction was indeed a proximate cause of the accident, which is part of the negligence analysis. Option D misapplies the law by suggesting that any personal errand negates liability, while the deviation must be substantial to affect vicarious liability. \n\nBar Exam Tip: Remember that minor deviations from an employment task often do not eliminate vicarious liability. Focus on the connection between the employee’s actions and their job responsibilities."
