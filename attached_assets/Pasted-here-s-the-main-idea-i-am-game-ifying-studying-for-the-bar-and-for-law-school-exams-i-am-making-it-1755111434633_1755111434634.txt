here's the main idea: i am game-ifying studying for the bar and for law school exams. i am making it fun and desirable and also making people feel like they are a part of a community of 'nerds' that is akin to harry potter or elden ring, which law students love to think they are associated with. i want this to work by showing real progress. that is, users have a character and they progress in their stats by competing against themselves or against each other in order to level up and build out their stats by getting questions correct across MBE topics and subtopics. this progress should be medium-hard to achieve but should be visible. the questions, of course, but be attached to those stats. they must be GOOD. very good. thats the crux. there cannot be bugs. you duel with your friends by playing against them, but it doesnt have to be real-time. for example, i can answer an MBE question, then by friend answers. whoever gets the most right in that round wins the round. i take XP from them if i beat them, and vice versa. you can climb the leaderboard and compete. this must all be tracked and users must be able to see their progress and log back in so that they do not feel that they have lost progress. do you understand my vision?

I 100% get it.

Your core, in one line
Make bar prep feel like a legit game: great questions → visible stat gains → status in a nerdy, law-fantasy community. Players keep coming back because their skills and rank go up—and they can beat friends asynchronously.

Below is a tight, hand-off brief you can paste into Replit. It’s only the essentials to make your exact vision real.

LAW DUEL — Core Spec (ship this, nothing else)
North Star
Every match must teach, reward, and rank: high-quality MBE questions tied to my weakest subtopics, instant visible progress (XP + Mastery), and wins that move a weekly ladder—even when duels are asynchronous.

Game Modes (all use the same engine)
Solo Run (5 Q): Targets user’s weakest subtopics (≥3/5). Immediate XP/Mastery updates.

Async Friend Duel (5 Q each): Player A answers now; Player B answers later. Round winner = most correct; ties break by total time to correct. XP and rating transfer between friends.

Daily Casefile (3 hard Q): Double XP; streak booster.

Questions (the crux)
MBE-style only. One clear rule + short explanation.

Tagged with Subject + Subtopic + Difficulty (1–10).

No repeats within a match.

If AI gen fails, fallback bank keeps the round going.

Quality gate: schema valid, 4 clean choices, mutually exclusive, explanation <120 words, includes rule anchor (e.g., “FRE 801(d)(1)(C)”).

Visible Progress (must be felt)
After each Q: popup chip like
+12 XP · Evidence/Hearsay · Mastery +3

Result screen: level bar moves, top 3 subtopic arrows (↑/↓), match accuracy, “+40 XP to Level 3.”

Profile → Stats: Subject → Subtopic mastery (0–100), history, streak days.

Ranking & Community
Async Elo for friend duels: K=24; show Rating +14 (1242→1256).

Weekly Ladder (resets Mon): Friends | School | Global.

Streak banner: “Day 3 — +10% XP today.”

Persistence (no lost progress)
Auth session; all XP, mastery, rating, streaks stored server-side.

Users can log back in on any device and see the same progress.

Timers & Fairness
Per question: 25s server-auth timer (applies to Solo + each friend round).

First answer locks; late/duplicate answers ignored.

In async duels, both players get the same 5 questions (order randomized per player).

Anti-bug guardrails
Server picks and stores questions before round starts.

All scoring, XP, mastery updates are server authoritative and atomic.

Structured logs for every question + stat change.

Pass/Fail Acceptance Tests
Quality & targeting: In Solo, a user flagged “weak in Hearsay” gets ≥3/5 Hearsay until mastery rises; questions pass the quality gate.

Progress felt: After a 5-Q Solo (3 correct), the XP bar moves, at least one subtopic ↑, stats reflect correct/attempted immediately.

Async duel works: A and B complete at different times; both see identical question set; winner gains XP/rating, loser loses; Weekly Ladder updates.

No repeats in a match: 50 test matches → 0 duplicates within any single match.

Resilience: Force AI failure; match still completes via fallback bank.

Persistence: Log out/in on another device → all stats, streak, rating, and pending friend rounds are intact.

Definition of Done (one sentence):

A player can play Solo or an async Friend Duel, get excellent questions, see XP & Mastery rise instantly, and watch their ladder rank change—with no duplicates, no desyncs, and no lost progress.

If you paste this into Replit as the milestone brief, they’ll have zero ambiguity. This is your core—nothing muddy, no extras.








You said:
and these questions are attached to openai source so the questions are always fresh and get harder. but they are tagged to topics. also, people should be able to see each others stats. are you with me?

I’m with you. Here’s a tight, copy-paste brief for Replit that adds exactly those pieces—fresh OpenAI questions with topic tags + adaptive difficulty + public stats.

Add This Now — Fresh AI Qs, Adaptive, Public Stats
A) Question Source = OpenAI (with guardrails)
Rule: Server generates questions via OpenAI, validates, tags, and caches. Client never calls OpenAI directly.

Server prompt (natural language, deterministic):

css
Copy
Edit
System: You generate bar-exam quality multiple-choice questions. Output STRICT JSON only.
Each item must include: subject, subtopic, difficulty(1-10), prompt, choices[4], answerIndex, explanation(<120w), authority_hint.
No extra text.

User: Create {COUNT} MBE-style questions targeted to these topics:
Subjects/Subtopics: {list from spec or user’s weakest areas}
Difficulty curve: {e.g., [3,4,5,6,7]}
Style: concise fact patterns; mutually exclusive answer choices; clear rule-first explanation.
Return JSON: { "questions": [ { ... } ] }
Validation & cache (server-side):

JSON schema check; 4 choices; 0<=answerIndex<=3; length limits.

Compute checksum = sha256(prompt+choices+answerIndex); dedupe.

Save to DB with fields: subject, subtopic, difficulty, source='openai', checksum.

If gen fails → fallback to bank so matches never stall.

Cost & quality controls:

Generate in batches of 5–10 and reuse for similar specs (cache).

Rate-limit per user; log token cost.

temperature low (e.g., 0.2) for consistency.

B) Adaptive Difficulty (gets harder as you improve)
Selection algorithm (server):

For Solo/Async: pick ≥3/5 from lowest-mastery subtopics.

Difficulty curve per user:

Start at 3–5. If last 10 answers ≥70% correct in a subtopic → shift to 5–7.

If ≤40% → drop to 2–4 until mastery nudges up.

Ensure no duplicates within a match; same 5 Qs for both players in async duels (order randomized).

C) Public Stats & Profiles (community feel)
Public profile URL/slug (username): shows

Level + XP bar

Elo rating

Subject mastery bars and top 5 subtopics (0–100)

Recent matches (W/L, opponent, subjects)

Privacy toggle in settings: Public (default), Friends-only, Private.

Leaderboards pull from public profiles only.

Endpoints (minimal):

GET /profile/:username → public stats snapshot

GET /leaderboard?scope=weekly|all&group=friends|school|global

POST /duel/async/start, POST /duel/async/answer, GET /duel/async/:id

D) What the UI must show (to feel “real progress”)
After each answer: chip → +XP · Subject/Subtopic · Mastery +/−N

Result screen: XP bar moved; subtopic arrows ↑/↓; “Rating +14 (1242→1256)” if vs human.

Public profile link on result screen: “View your profile • Share”

E) Pass/Fail Acceptance Tests
Fresh + tagged: Start 10 Solo matches for a user weak in Hearsay → ≥3/5 Hearsay per match; each Q has subject, subtopic, difficulty, explanation; no repeats within a match.

Adaptive: After user hits ≥80% on Hearsay over 2 matches, next match includes Hearsay at higher avg difficulty (+1–2 pts).

Async duel parity: A and B play at different times; both receive the same 5 questions; winner gains XP/Elo; ladder updates.

Persistence & visibility: Log out/in → all XP/mastery/rating intact; visiting /profile/:username shows live stats (unless user set Private).

Resilience: Force OpenAI failure → duel completes using cached/bank questions; logs show fallback.

Cost guard: Gen pipeline caches and reuses; average token spend per match under your set budget threshold.

Definition of Done:

Players get fresh, well-tagged OpenAI questions that adapt to their skill, gain visible XP/mastery and Elo, and can share public profiles/leaderboard standings—with no match blocked by generation issues.

This adds exactly what you asked—freshness, adaptive challenge, and public status—without bloating the build.
