1) Rank (ELO) — competitive
Problem: Everyone starts at 1200 and shows “Skilled.”
Fix: Hide rank until placements. Show Unranked (Placements 0/5).

Start with hidden MMR=1200.

5 placement duels → reveal rank.

ELO bands & names:

Paralegal: <1050

1L: 1050–1149

2L: 1150–1249

3L: 1250–1349

Associate: 1350–1449

Senior Associate: 1450–1549

Counsel: 1550–1649

Partner: 1650–1799

Trialmaster: 1800–1949

Supreme Advocate: 1950+

Show rank progress bar: “+18 / -14 next match” and animate deltas on result.

2) Level (XP) — “name for each level”
This is your always-forward bar. You level up by playing, not just winning.

XP Sources

Correct answer: +20 (easy), +25 (med), +30 (hard)

Duel win: +100; loss: +40

Streak bonus: +10 per consecutive win (caps at +50)

First duel of day: +100

Subject Gauntlet clear: +150

Underdog win (beat higher ELO): +50

Level curve
Use: XP_to_next = ceil(220 * level^1.35)
(Feels fast early, meaningful later.)

3) Subject Mastery — micro skill (per MBE subject)
Each subject has Mastery 0–10 (Roman numerals I–X). Mastery points adjust every question.

Start Provisional until 20 attempts in that subject.

Mastery points per question = +8 (correct) / −3 (wrong) × difficulty weight (0.8/1/1.2).

Thresholds (cumulative): 0, 80, 170, 270, 380, 500, 630, 770, 920, 1080, 1250.

Show: Accuracy %, attempts, streak, Mastery I–X badge.

Light weekly decay: −10 points per subject (floors at the lower tier) to keep engagement.

UI copy & behavior
Top of Stats page:

If <5 placements: Rank: Unranked (Placements 2/5)

Else: Rank: 2L — 1187 ELO with progress bar to 3L.

Next row: Level 7 · Discovery Adept — progress bar “430/620 XP”.

Subject grid chips: “Evidence — Mastery III, 72% · 94 Qs · Streak 4 (Provisional if <20)”.

Post-match:

Big XP card: “+100 Win, +60 Correct, +20 Streak = +180 XP → Level Up!”

ELO delta card: “Beat higher ELO: +22 (1187 → 1209).”

Subject deltas: “Evidence +18 pts (Mastery II → III).”

Addictive loops (daily/weekly)
Daily Casefile (1 curated duel): +100 XP, double mastery.

Weekly Bounties: “Win 5 Con Law duels” = badge + 500 XP.

Season Ladder (4 weeks): soft reset of rank; cosmetics carry.

Friend Rivalry: weekly head-to-head board with tiny rewards.

Acceptance criteria
New account shows Unranked (0/5) and Level 1: Novice Scribe.

After 1 duel win with 3 correct, XP increases and Level progress animates; rank stays hidden until placements complete.

Subject cards update after each answered question; Mastery moves in visible steps; “Provisional” disappears ≥20 attempts.

Rank tier names change strictly by ELO band; level titles change strictly by XP, never by ELO.
