how do i make sure that the questions are working in replit and are effectively tied to the player's progress? that duels work?
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 35s

Totally get the need for a clear, “does this actually work?” check. Here’s how to prove (in Replit) that:

questions are being created and served,

each answer updates the player’s stats (XP + subtopic mastery),

async duels use the same 5 questions for both players and move Elo/ladder.

I made you a tiny smoke-test script you can run right away.

Download: lawduel_smoke.sh

What this does (in 5–7 minutes)

Logs in User A and User B (uses debuguser/test123 & debugfriend/test123—change in env if needed).

Starts a Solo match for A → submits one answer → checks /api/stats/subtopics for a bump on that subtopic.

Starts an Async Friend Duel A→B → verifies both players got the same 5 questionIds → answers → fetches duel result (to check Elo/XP fields).

Fails fast with a red ✗ if any of the contract points are broken.

How to run it

In Replit shell (or your terminal):

chmod +x lawduel_smoke.sh
BASE="https://<your-app>.replit.app" ./lawduel_smoke.sh


Replace <your-app>.replit.app with your production URL.

If your test usernames/passwords differ, set:

USER_A="youruser" PASS_A="yourpass" USER_B="friend" PASS_B="friendpass" \
BASE="https://<your-app>.replit.app" ./lawduel_smoke.sh


PASS criteria you’ll see in the output:

“Solo started duelId=… with questions …”

“Answer accepted”

“Stats updated: <Subject>/<Subtopic> attempts=1”

“Async parity OK: both players have same question set”

“Duel result endpoint responded (verify Elo/XP fields in JSON)”

If any step prints a red ✗, that’s the exact place to send back to the agent.

If the script FAILs, here’s what that means (and the fix to demand)

Solo start fails / no duelId
➜ Matchmaker not returning a server-authored question set.
Fix: server must reserve 5 questionIds and return them.

Answer accepted but Stats don’t move
➜ recordAttempt(userId, duelId, questionId, subject, subtopic, difficulty, correct, ms, ts) is not being called at answer time (or idempotency key missing).
Fix: call it in the server’s answer handler; update/persist SubtopicMastery immediately; return masteryDelta and xpGained in response.

Async parity failed (A & B different question IDs)
➜ You’re regenerating questions per user or not storing reservations.
Fix: on A’s start, store the 5 questionIds in question_reservations keyed by duelId; B loads the same list.

No duel result / Elo unchanged
➜ Result aggregation not writing rating/XP or no /api/duel/result/:id.
Fix: compute Elo (K≈24), write both deltas, expose a result endpoint.

Minimal API contracts this script expects

POST /api/auth/login → { ok, user } and sets cookie

GET /api/auth/me → { ok, user } when logged in

POST /api/duel/solo/start → { duelId, questions:[{questionId,subject,subtopic,difficulty}] }

POST /api/duel/answer → { ok, xpGained, masteryDelta:{subtopicId,before,after} }

GET /api/stats/subtopics → subjects with nested subtopics including attempts

POST /api/duel/async/start → { duelId, questions:[...] }

POST /api/duel/async/answer → { ok }

GET /api/duel/async/:duelId → { duelId, questions:[...] } (for B to fetch)

GET /api/duel/result/:duelId → { winnerId, yourScore, oppScore, eloDelta, xpGained }

If any endpoint names differ, have Replit add thin wrappers to match these—your core logic doesn’t need to change, and you’ll get repeatable tests.

Extra sanity checks (30 seconds in the browser)

After each answer in UI, you see a chip: +XP · Subject/Subtopic · Mastery +N.

Refresh Stats → Subtopics: the subtopic you just answered shows attempts incremented and mastery nudged.

Start an async duel vs friend: both see identical question IDs (order can differ) and the Weekly Ladder moves when it’s done.

This gives you a repeatable, objective “is it working?” lever. Run it any time the agent claims something’s fixed; you’ll get a clear PASS/FAIL with the exact point of breakage.

any other important sanity checks so i can finally deploy the beta?
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 22s

Absolutely—here’s a tight beta-ready sanity checklist. If all of these pass, you can ship a closed beta confidently.

🔐 Auth & Sessions

Same-origin in prod: SPA served by Express; API paths are /api/*.

Cookie: sid present, HttpOnly, Secure (prod), SameSite=Lax.

/auth/me returns 200 after full refresh and on another device.

Idempotent login: repeated POST /login doesn’t create duplicate sessions.

🧠 Question Engine (AI + Pool)

No sync calls on match start (OpenAI runs in background worker).

Pool inventory: each (Subject, Subtopic, diff-band) ≥ target (e.g., 150).

Schema-valid: every Q has 4 choices, answerIndex 0–3, short explanation, tags.

Deduped: checksum prevents identical questions in DB.

User freshness: same user doesn’t see a repeat within 30 days.

🕹️ Gameplay Flow

Solo: 5 questions, server timer (e.g., 25s or your 60s), late answers rejected.

Async Friend Duel: both players get the same 5 questionIds; winner by corrects → time tiebreak.

No duplicates within a match (1000-match sim = 0 dupes).

Reconnect: drop/rejoin within grace resumes the same question.

📈 Progression & Stats (the core you care about)

On answer server updates: XP, streak, SubtopicMastery, attempts/correct; returns xpGained & masteryDelta.

Subtopics tab shows the exact subtopic you just answered, without reload hacks.

Result screen matches the per-question chips (numbers line up).

Persistence: log out/in on another device → stats unchanged.

🧮 Ranking & Community

Elo applied at duel end; result screen shows +XX (old→new).

Weekly ladder (ISO week) updates immediately; no zero-point users.

Bots labeled with gamer tags + unique avatars; clearly non-human.

Public profiles: /profile/:username viewable cross-account (unless Private).

📅 Daily Casefile & Streaks

Today playable (not pre-answered).

Timer targets midnight UTC; label says “resets at 00:00 UTC”.

Streak: consecutive UTC days increments; skip resets to 1; playing twice in one day doesn’t increment twice.

⚡ Performance & Stability

P95 server event <150 ms during 100 concurrent duels (or your target).

No crash on OpenAI 429: matches run from pool; generator pauses & resumes.

Heartbeats: ghost clients dropped within 5s; no stuck duels.

🧭 Observability (your lifeline)

Audit log per answer: (userId, duelId, questionId, subject, subtopic, correct, ms, ts).

Key counters: matches_total, dupes_in_match (should be 0), elo_updates_total, gen_failovers_total.

Admin views: pool inventory by bucket; generator status; last OpenAI error.

🔒 Security & Abuse Basics

Rate-limit answer submits (min 1/sec).

Server-authoritative scoring; ignore duplicate/late answers.

Input validation on all JSON bodies; reject unmapped tags.

🧪 Quick spot checks (curl)

Auth:

curl -i -c jar.txt -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"username":"debuguser","password":"test123"}' https://<app>/api/auth/login
curl -i -b jar.txt https://<app>/api/auth/me   # expect 200


Solo start:

curl -s -b jar.txt https://<app>/api/duel/solo/start | jq '.questions | length' # expect 5


Stats move: answer one → GET /api/stats/subtopics shows attempts++ for that subtopic.

🛑 Stop-ship red flags

Any mismatch between chip numbers ↔ result screen ↔ Stats page.

Async duel players get different questionIds.

/auth/me flips to 401 after refresh or on a second device.

OpenAI quota stops matches (means you’re still calling sync).

✅ Go/No-Go criteria (closed beta)

Activation (finish 1 match) ≥ 70%

Bug-free matches (no dupes/desyncs) ≥ 99%

Async duel rematch rate ≥ 25%

Daily streak increments correctly for 3 consecutive days (manual test)

If you want, run the smoke script I gave you plus these spot checks. Anything red—send the exact bullet back to the dev with “FAIL: <bullet>” so they know precisely what to fix.

how do i know this is gonna run and people are gonna be able to get on and its not gonna crash or something
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 26s

Totally fair fear. Here’s a no-drama “will it run?” plan that makes crashes and login loops extremely unlikely, and gives you hard proofs before you invite anyone.

1) Lock the basics (so auth & sessions don’t blow up)

Same origin in prod: serve the React build from Express; the browser only hits https://<your-app>.replit.app/*.

Session store: not MemoryStore. Use Postgres/Redis; set cookie: { httpOnly:true, secure:true, sameSite:'lax', path:'/' }, app.set('trust proxy', 1).

Client fetch: every call uses credentials: 'include'. One miss = login loop.

2) Add one health endpoint (green or not)

Implement /health returning JSON like:

{
  "ok": true,
  "version": "2025-08-14-01",
  "uptime_sec": 1234,
  "db": "ok",
  "sessionStore": "ok",
  "questionPool": { "total": 1830, "lowBuckets": 0 },
  "openai": { "generator": "paused|running", "callsToday": 1420, "resetsAtUTC": "00:00" }
}


If ok=false or any field is “fail”, you don’t launch.

3) Pre-fill the AI pool (so OpenAI can’t stall matches)

Run the background generator until each (Subject, Subtopic, difficulty-band) has inventory (e.g., ≥150/bucket).

Verify with /admin/pool (counts by bucket).

Generator disabled during launch window (pool only), then re-enable at a low rate.

4) Run 3 smoke tests (prove end-to-end)

Auth (prod domain):

curl -i -c jar.txt -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"username":"debuguser","password":"test123"}' https://<app>/api/auth/login
curl -i -b jar.txt https://<app>/api/auth/me   # expect 200


Solo stats move: Start Solo → answer 1 → GET /api/stats/subtopics shows attempts++ for that subtopic.

Async parity: A starts async vs B → both get same 5 questionIds → finish → Elo & weekly ladder change.

(You already have my script to automate this; run it before every deploy.)

5) Quick load test (light but real)

From a laptop, hit the Solo start endpoint to 50 RPS for 60s (or use k6/autocannon). Target:

No 5xx

P95 < 150 ms for Solo start and answer endpoints

DB connections steady (not climbing to max)

6) Set hard SLOs for beta

Availability (auth + Solo start): 99.5% in the first week

Latency: P95 < 150 ms for answer/feedback

Bug-free matches (no dupes/desyncs): ≥ 99%

No sync OpenAI calls on match start (0 during duel paths)

If any SLO breaches in the first hour, pause invites (see killswitch below) and ship a hotfix.

7) Add a killswitch + maintenance banner

Env flag MAINTENANCE_MODE=true → all new duels return 503 with a friendly banner; existing duels/Stats still load.

A second flag DISABLE_GENERATOR=true to pause OpenAI worker without affecting gameplay.

8) Guardrails that prevent “crashy” behavior

Answer rate-limit: min 1 req/sec per user; ignore duplicates and late answers.

Server-authoritative timers; clients can’t extend time.

Circuit breaker for OpenAI worker (on 429/5xx → backoff; gameplay unaffected).

DB pool sane defaults (e.g., PG: max=10–20, idleTimeout=30s, statement_timeout=5s).

Unhandled errors:

process.on('unhandledRejection', e => console.error(e));
process.on('uncaughtException', e => console.error(e));


Plus Express error middleware, so one bad route doesn’t take down the process.

9) Minimal monitoring you can actually use today

/metrics or logs: counters for matches_total, dupe_in_match_total, elo_updates_total, gen_failovers_total.

Uptime ping from any free monitor hitting /health every minute (alert on non-200 or "ok":false).

Log a single duel_summary row per match (score, subjects, durations, errors).

10) Canary rollout (so “people can get on” without chaos)

Invite 20 testers first hour (friends + 2L/3L mix). Watch /health, logs, and counters.

If green, open to 50 more.

Keep generator throttled until you see stable pool consumption.

Your quick GO/NO-GO (use this literally)

/health shows ok:true, pool ≥ target, sessions “ok”.

Curl auth test on prod URL returns 200 and cookie sticks.

Smoke script: PASS on Solo stats move, Async parity, and Duel result.

60s load spike → 0 5xx; P95 < 150 ms.

Killswitch tested once (returns 503 banner, not a crash).

If all five are true → ship the beta.
If any fail, paste the failing bullet back to your dev with “STOP-SHIP: <bullet>”.

This is the boring scaffolding that keeps your launch from exploding, and it’s lean enough to do today.
