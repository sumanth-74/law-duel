Yes. Ship this as Daily Casefile (one hard Q/day). Here’s a tight, copy-pasteable spec for your Replit agent.

What it is
A single, hard MBE question available to every user once per day. Answer → instant explanation, XP, and subject-mastery change. Resets daily with a countdown.

Rules
One attempt/day/user. First submit is final.

Time limit: 75–90s.

Difficulty: hard-tagged items only.

Reset: midnight local time (store user.timezone; fallback UTC).

Visibility: Home banner + badge on nav; lock after attempt.

Rewards (tunable)
Correct: +150 XP, +2× mastery points for that subject, +1 “Daily Streak”.

Incorrect: +30 XP, normal mastery change, streak breaks (unless shield).

Streak milestones: 3/7/14/30 → cosmetic + tiny bonus XP (50/100/200/400).

Data model (tables/fields)
daily_questions
id, date_utc, subject, topic, difficulty, stem, choices[4], correct_index, explanation_long, rule_refs[]

user_daily_attempts
user_id, question_id, answered_at, is_correct, choice_index, xp_awarded

users (add): timezone, daily_streak, last_daily_date

(Optional) daily_schedule if you want to pre-queue dates → question_ids.

API
GET /daily-question

Returns today’s question without correct_index if user not attempted.

If attempted, return result summary (correct?, choice, explanation, next reset).

POST /daily-answer { questionId, choiceIndex }

Server validates “first attempt today”, checks correctness, writes attempt, computes XP + mastery deltas, updates streak, returns payload:

arduino
Copy
Edit
{ correct: true/false, xpDelta, masteryDelta, newLevel?, newStreak, explanationLong }
GET /daily-streak (optional)

Returns current streak + best streak and milestone progress.

UI (quick)
Home card: “Daily Casefile — Hard • [Subject] • Resets in 12:34:56” → CTA “Answer”.

Question view: timer pill, stem, choices A–D. Disable other nav.

Result: big ✅/❌, explanation, “+150 XP • Evidence Mastery +18 (II→III)”, buttons: “Rematch a friend in [Subject]” + “Share streak”.

Locked state: after attempt, show summary + next reset countdown.

Anti-cheat
Enforce one attempt on server; sign attempt with user_id + date key.

Shuffle choices server-side; don’t send correct index until after submit.

Rate-limit POST; ignore repeat submits for that day.

Scheduling (content)
Simple v1: if daily_questions has a row for today, serve it; else pick a random hard question with subject rotation (e.g., Evidence → Torts → …).

Admin script to seed next 30 days.

Analytics (log events)
daily_view, daily_start, daily_submit, daily_correct, daily_xp_award, daily_streak_continue/break. Dashboard: % users who attempt, correctness rate, streak distribution.

Acceptance checks
New user sees banner; after answering correctly, XP and subject mastery update; streak = 1.

Second submit same day is rejected; UI shows locked state + countdown.

At local midnight, new question appears; streak increments if answered on consecutive days.
