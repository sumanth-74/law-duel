Climb the ladder. Correct answers = growth + points; Atticus gives the rule + why.

Why it works (short, adult)

Testing effect: recall beats rereading.

Pressure calibration: 20-second decisions simulate exam pace.

Focused feedback: one dispositive fact; concise rule-based explanations.

Replace landing copy with outcome-driven content (no layout refactor).

Hero:

H1: “Beat the bar. Beat your class.”

Sub: “Duel on real MBE-style questions—live or async. Grow your avatar as you master the law. Atticus explains every answer.”

Buttons: Start a Duel (primary), Try a 30-sec demo (secondary → loads a single canned question and the duel UI with a fake opponent).

Proof chips: “1L & Bar • Same question head-to-head • < 8s matching • Explanation on every item”.

Replace the three purple feature cards with How it works (3 steps), Why it works (3 bullets), and an Audience toggle (tabs “1L Exams” | “Bar Prep” that just swaps the bullet list of subjects).

Add a small Async Duels banner: “Keep 5–10 matches going. Your inbox lights up when it’s your turn.”

Add an Ask Atticus teaser: a line + button that opens the existing Atticus modal.

Keep login link minimal; add Play as Guest near the primary CTA.

Copy tone: mature, clinical, concise. No cutesy emojis. Cinzel headings, Inter Tight body.

Acceptance:

Above-the-fold shows the two CTAs and proof chips.

The three middle cards are replaced by “How it works / Why it works / Audience”.

The demo launches a single canned duel without signup; finishing the demo routes to “Create account” or “Quick Match”.

Audience tabs copy:

1L Exams: Civ Pro, Contracts (incl. UCC), Torts, Property, Crim, Con Law

Bar Prep: All MBE subjects with bar-level difficulty

Async banner: “Like Game Pigeon, but for the law. Take your turns when you’re free.”

Atticus teaser: “Ask Atticus: rule → application → why the others are wrong.”

Quick polish that sells
Swap the hero art for a tight in-product screenshot of the duel screen (timer, choices, avatars) — that instantly communicates the goal.

Put social proof when you have it (quotes, school badges). Until then, keep it minimal and confident.
