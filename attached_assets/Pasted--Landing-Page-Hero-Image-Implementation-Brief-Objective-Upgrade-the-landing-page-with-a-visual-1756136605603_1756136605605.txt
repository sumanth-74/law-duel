🚀 Landing Page Hero Image — Implementation Brief

Objective:
Upgrade the landing page with a visually arresting hero section that feels Elden Ring x Harry Potter, but keeps the current Law Duel vibe and logo intact.

🔮 Visual Requirements

Color & Brand Consistency:

Stick with the existing purple gradient palette.

Atticus the Purple Wizard Cat (our logo mascot) must remain the central symbol.

Image Concept:

A fantasy courtroom/arena where Atticus presides.

Think arcane legal duel — glowing runes, magical law books, ethereal light.

Quality bar = cinematic fantasy art (Elden Ring atmospherics, Harry Potter magic).

Composition:

Hero image fills the top section of the landing page.

Overlay current logo + tagline (“Learn the law through epic legal duels”).

Buttons (Sign Up / Play Now) must stand out against the background (use a dark gradient overlay for readability).

⚙️ Technical Steps in Replit

Generate the artwork

AI prompt example:

“Purple wizard cat in robes, glowing staff, magical courtroom, arcane runes, law tomes floating, Elden Ring x Harry Potter dark fantasy style, premium, cinematic, purple tones.”

Export at 2560x1440px (for desktop retina) + generate smaller responsive versions.

Place in public/assets/hero/hero-bg.png.

Update landing page component (Landing.tsx or similar):

Wrap hero section with a div that uses the image as a background-image (via Tailwind classes or inline CSS).

Add a linear-gradient overlay (bg-gradient-to-b from-black/60 via-purple-900/60 to-black/80) for readability.

Keep Logo & Branding

Position Atticus logo front and center, over the image.

Below logo, show the tagline.

Place CTAs (Sign Up, Play Now) below tagline, styled in the current premium purple scheme.

Responsiveness

Ensure mobile view crops the image elegantly (center Atticus, avoid cutting important detail).

Use object-cover and Tailwind’s responsive classes for scaling.

✅ Success Criteria

When you open lawduel.net, the first thing you see is a dramatic fantasy scene that feels magical and premium — but still matches the purple vibe and keeps Atticus as the brand anchor.

The logo is visible and unchanged.

Tagline + buttons are easy to read and click.

Works smoothly on desktop + mobile (no janky scaling).
